hello,world!

Welcome to this brand new blog.

I love talking about IT and many other stuff with my friends but they seems bored for some weird reasons.

So please allow me to introduce myself...

I'm a student in a CS School in France. I really like to learn and pratices new tools, technologies or think about best pratices in software engineering.

Also i'm quite interrested about philosophy, economics, self developement and learning new stuff, whatever they might be.

So you may read posts mostly related to functionnal programming, web development, distributed systems and system administration but also sometimes about music or some other stuff.

To conclude this draft i would just add that this blog is build with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed on [CleverCloud](https://www.clever-cloud.com).
