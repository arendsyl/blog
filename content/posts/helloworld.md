hello,world!

Welcome to this brand new blog.

I love talking about IT and many other stuff with my friends but they seem bored for some weird reasons.

So please allow me to introduce myself...

I'm a student in a CS School in France. I really like to learn and experiment with new tools, technologies or just read and think about best practices in software engineering.

Also I'm quite interested in philosophy, economics, self development and learning new stuff, whatever they should be.

So you may mostly read posts related to functional programming, web development, distributed systems and system administration but also sometimes about music or some other stuff.

To conclude this draft I would just add that this blog is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed on [CleverCloud](https://www.clever-cloud.com).
