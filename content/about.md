### whoami

I'm a 19 yo french student in a CS engineering school. 
My main objective is to fully understand how do work tools that i use in my daily life to automate them as much as i could.

I started programming with Python approximatly at 10, 11 yo. 
But few month after I discovered C and many people said that this language is better to get into programming : "C is harder but you will learn more"
So i learned C during my 11th year. 

During maybe two years i didn't code, i discovered Minecraft and electronics so i left Code::Blocks to redstone and soldering pen.

When a grew up to 14 i found a nice Youtube channel about Strategy Games (Paradox's ones) but the guy was also a developer. 
So i watched him explaining his project of website/webapp using Mongodb, AngularJS, Express and NodeJS (back in the days when Yeoman hasn't been replaced by a plethora of CLIs and npx).
I spent a lot of time trying to understand how this humongous stack worked, fascinated by the power of CLIs and the abundance of technologies...

This made me understand that my life of coding has just started and that i'll like computer science for long.

So now i've spent two years learning mathematics and CS in school and i've three more to go. 
I've learned a lot of thing during these two years and i'm still getting better and better each thanks to the amazing IT and CS community, my teachers and some incredible people.
